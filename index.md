title: About Me

I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics studying at National University of Singapore (NUS). I have a deep interest in the theories behind algorithms, especially quantum and randomized algorithms. My projects can be found [here](github.com/luffingluffy) and I can be reached at <hello@lutfirandiva.com>.
